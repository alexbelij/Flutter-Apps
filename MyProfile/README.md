# MyProfile

Instagram Profile built using Rows and Columns

## What I learned Building this App
- ```Column``` A widget that displays its children in a vertical array.
- ```Row``` A widget that displays its children in horizontal array.
- ```CircleAvatar``` : 
A circle that represents a user.
Typically used with a user's profile image, or, in the absence of such an image, the user's initials. A given user's initials should always be paired with the same background color, for consistency.
- ```Expand``` : A widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills the available space.
- ```Raised Button``` A raised button is based on a Material widget whose Material.elevation increases when the button is pressed.
