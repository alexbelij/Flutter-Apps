# BusinessCard

```Business Card App``` based on Cards in Flutter

## What I learned Building this App

- ```Card``` :  A material design card. A card has slightly rounded corners and a shadow.
- ```CircleAvatar``` : 
A circle that represents a user.
Typically used with a user's profile image, or, in the absence of such an image, the user's initials. A given user's initials should always be paired with the same background color, for consistency.
